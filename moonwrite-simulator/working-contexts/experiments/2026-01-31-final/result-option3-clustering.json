    "title": "Thermal-Aware Fault-Tolerant Control for Humanoid Robot Locomotion",
    "coreQuestion": "How can humanoid robots maintain stable locomotion when motor thermal limits or actuator failures occur during extended operation?",
    "coreArgument": "By combining physics-based thermal modeling (two-resistor model with learnable parameters) with learned failure estimation networks (FEMNet), robots can predict motor degradation and adapt their control policy in real-time to maintain locomotion despite thermal constraints and actuator failures.",
    "coreEvidence": [
      "Two-resistor thermal model with online-learned P1-P5 parameters achieves accurate winding/core temperature prediction",
      "FEMNet architecture (512x256x128 encoder + modulation network) successfully estimates fault vectors from observation history",
      "Experimental results show maintained walking capability under torque-limited conditions (1000-1389 steps)",
      "ToddlerBot platform demonstrates 19+ minute operation improvement with thermal-aware control"
    ]
  },
  "researchStory": {
    "motivation": "Humanoid robots experience motor overheating during locomotion, causing torque reduction and eventual failure. Like injured animals that adapt their gait, robots need intelligent strategies to continue operation under degraded conditions.",
    "gap": "Existing thermal models are either too simplified (2-resistor without adaptation) or too complex for real-time control. Fault detection typically requires explicit sensors rather than learning from motion patterns.",
    "contribution": "We propose a hybrid approach combining physics-based thermal modeling with learned parameters and a failure estimation network that infers actuator health from observation history alone.",
    "validation": "Simulation experiments in MuJoCo demonstrate accurate temperature prediction and maintained locomotion under various fault scenarios."
