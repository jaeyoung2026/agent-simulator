KEY INSIGHTS
------------
1. RESOLUTION EFFECTIVENESS
   → 2.6 units/slide provides excellent granularity
   → 92.3% coverage captures nearly all information
   → No over-segmentation risk detected
   → Balanced distribution (53% large units)

2. DISTRIBUTED STRATEGY PERFORMANCE
   → Thesis-first approach establishes coherent framework
   → Parallel Flash processing (Stage 2) enables efficiency
   → Consistency validation catches 43 issues early
   → Pro validation provides high-quality final check

3. CONSISTENCY CHALLENGE
   → 63.2% consistency needs improvement
   → 43 inconsistencies (36.8% of units) is high
   → Discussion section over-represented (47% vs 18%)
   → May need intermediate validation stage

4. COST-QUALITY BALANCE
   → $0.0533 total cost is reasonable
   → 82% spent on Pro validation (strategic use)
   → B+ quality rating justifies the investment
   → 3.6x more expensive than Low resolution

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
USE THIS CONFIGURATION WHEN:
  • Working with highly technical content
  • Information preservation is critical
  • Budget allows for Pro validation ($0.05/presentation)
  • Quality prioritized over speed
  • Detailed methodology/analysis required

IMPROVE CONSISTENCY (63.2% → 75%+):
  • Add Stage 2.5: Pre-validation before Pro
  • Increase thesis connection threshold (0.7 → 0.75)
  • Balance section representation in Stage 2
  • Reduce unit count for simple slides

REDUCE COST ($0.0533 → $0.0300):
  • Replace Stage 4 Pro with Flash
  • Optimize Stage 2 token consumption
  • Batch processing optimizations
  • Remove redundant validation steps

INCREASE COVERAGE (92.3% → 95%+):
  • Increase max units/slide (5 → 7)
  • Lower complexity thresholds in Stage 2
  • More aggressive segmentation
  • Add image analysis tokens

FINAL VERDICT
-------------
Rating: 8.5/10 ████████▌

High Resolution + Distributed Strategy is a STRONG CHOICE for:
  → Technical/scientific presentations
  → When detail preservation is paramount
  → Budget allows strategic Pro usage
  → Quality over speed is the priority

The thesis-first distributed approach provides excellent information
coverage (92.3%) with manageable over-segmentation risk (0%). While
consistency could be improved (63.2%), the overall B+ quality rating
and reasonable cost ($0.0533) make this configuration ideal for
complex technical content where detail matters.

IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL:
  Add intermediate validation stage between Step 3 and 4 to reduce
  inconsistencies before Pro validation. This could boost consistency
  from 63.2% to 75%+ with minimal cost increase.
