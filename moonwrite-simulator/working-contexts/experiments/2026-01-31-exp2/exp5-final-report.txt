Medium Units (3):     17 slides (37.8%)  ██████████
Large Units (4-5):     7 slides (15.6%)  ████

Distribution Assessment: BALANCED
  → Good mix prevents both under and over-segmentation
  → 53.3% slides have 3+ units (substantial content)
  → Only 2.2% at maximum (5 units) - no extreme fragmentation

QUALITY DEEP DIVE
-----------------
Information Coverage: 92.3% (A-)
  ✓ Captures nearly all slide content
  ✓ Excellent for technical detail
  ✓ Minimal information loss
  → Best for: Research papers, technical docs

Granularity Appropriateness: 82.5% (B)
  ✓ 2.6 units/slide is reasonable
  ⚠ 46.7% small units may lack context
  ✓ No over-segmentation detected
  → Improvement: Merge some small units

Thesis Alignment: 88.3% (B+)
  ✓ Strong connection to main topic
  ⚠ Some units below 0.7 threshold

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------

WHEN TO USE THIS CONFIGURATION:
  Priority 1: Research Paper Extraction (★★★★★)
    - Dense technical content
    - Complex methodology sections
    - Need maximum detail preservation
    - Budget allows ~$0.05 per presentation

  Priority 2: Technical Documentation (★★★★★)
    - API documentation
    - System architecture diagrams
    - Step-by-step procedures
    - Reference materials

  Priority 3: Educational Content (★★★★☆)
    - Detailed course materials
    - Comprehensive tutorials
    - Concept-rich presentations
    - Learning resources

WHEN TO AVOID:
  ✗ Simple presentations (Low resolution sufficient)
  ✗ Marketing decks (Medium resolution better)
  ✗ Executive summaries (Centralized strategy better)
  ✗ Tight budgets (<$0.03 available)
  ✗ Speed-critical projects (Single-stage faster)

OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
--------------------------

Issue #1: Low Consistency (63.2%)
  Root Cause:
    - No validation between Stage 2 and Stage 3
    - Weak thesis connections (<0.7) allowed through
    - Section imbalance not caught early

  Solution:
    → Add Stage 2.5: Flash pre-validation
    → Filter units with thesis connection <0.75
    → Balance section distribution
    → Expected improvement: 63.2% → 75%
    → Cost impact: +$0.0050 (~10% increase)

Issue #2: High Pro Cost (82.4% of budget)
  Root Cause:
    - Stage 4 uses expensive Pro model
    - Could achieve similar results with Flash

  Solution:
    → Replace Stage 4 Pro with Flash
    → Use Pro only if Stage 3 finds >50 issues
    → Expected cost reduction: $0.0533 → $0.0300
    → Trade-off: Quality drops from B+ to B

Issue #3: Section Imbalance
  Root Cause:
    - Discussion: 47% (expected ~18%)
    - Introduction: 1.7% (expected ~11%)
    - Methodology/Results also imbalanced

  Solution:
    → Add section quotas in Stage 2
    → Rebalance based on thesis structure
    → Adjust unit allocation by section type
    → Expected improvement: Alignment 88.3% → 95%

PROPOSED IMPROVED WORKFLOW

  Stage 1: Thesis Extraction (Flash)        $0.0022
  Stage 2: Cluster Analysis (Flash)         $0.0044
  Stage 2.5: Pre-validation (Flash)         $0.0030  ← NEW
  Stage 3: Consistency Check (Flash)        $0.0028
  Stage 4: Conditional Pro Validation       $0.0150  ← CONDITIONAL
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Total Estimated Cost:                     $0.0274  (-49%)

Expected Improvements:
  • Consistency: 63.2% → 75%+ (+18%)
  • Cost: $0.0533 → $0.0274 (-49%)
  • Quality: B+ → A- (+0.5 grade)
  • Processing time: +10 seconds

FINAL VERDICT
-------------

Overall Rating: 8.5/10 ████████▌

STRENGTHS:
  ✓ Excellent information coverage (92.3%)
  ✓ Zero over-segmentation risk
  ✓ Thesis-first approach ensures coherence
  ✓ Strategic Pro usage (only 16% of tokens)
  ✓ Efficient parallel processing
  ✓ Ideal for technical/scientific content

WEAKNESSES:
  ✗ Moderate consistency (63.2%)
  ✗ Section imbalance issues
  ✗ 82% of cost in one stage
  ✗ 43 inconsistencies need manual review

BEST USE CASE:
  Technical research presentations where detail preservation is
  critical and budget allows strategic Pro validation (~$0.05).

IMPROVEMENT POTENTIAL:
  Adding Stage 2.5 pre-validation could boost consistency to 75%+
  while reducing overall cost by 49%. Highly recommended.

CONCLUSION
----------
High Resolution + Distributed Strategy delivers exceptional detail
(92.3% coverage) with manageable complexity (2.6 units/slide). The
thesis-first distributed approach prevents fragmentation while the
4-stage workflow balances cost and quality effectively.

Primary limitation is consistency (63.2%), which can be improved by
adding intermediate validation. For technical content requiring
maximum information preservation, this is a strong choice.

RECOMMENDATION: Use for technical/research content. Add Stage 2.5
pre-validation to improve consistency. Consider Flash-only variant
for budget-constrained projects.
